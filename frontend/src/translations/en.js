    location: 'San José, Costa Rica',
    bio: 'Woman, mother, artist and poet, many facets move daily in my life and home, whose experiences are enriched by the warmth and color of art. I am a Costa Rican visual artist and poet. I have exhibited my art and poetry both within and outside the country: in Panama, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Canada, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Dubai, Venezuela, India, Turkey, Seoul, Australia, Denmark, France, Cuba, among others. I am a member of the Antonio Montes Cultural Association of Málaga, Spain. Delegate and Academic Lady of Mondial Art Academia, France. Certified Artist of the Museum of the Americas, USA. I have published two poetry books: En las Mejillas del Tiempo and Otra vez, volvió a amanecer. My favorite technique is acrylic on canvas, and I have two styles: humanized vessels in which I express my feelings full of poetry, and deconstructed animals where the main message is to seek and preserve essence despite life\'s vicissitudes.',
    quote: 'In life we live with things, with pain, with other things, with warmth and sweetness. Emotional color arises spontaneously in our new palette diary.',

        description: 'I paint nature from a different, fragmented and free path, stylizing its forms and inviting this path to break paradigms and programs, without losing the essence of what we really are, and a message we hope for; so that we weigh all our lives, we are always happy.'

        title: 'Intermediate Styles 2',
        description: 'I paint feelings through the forms of humanized vessels, they are acrylics loaded with textures and poetry, with an explicit feeling that speaks, in silence, with its forms and colors to the viewer.'

        title: 'Deconstructed Fauna',
        description: 'One of the styles I share is that of motifs of fauna, mostly Costa Rican, in deconstructed form, in which the message comes hidden in a kind of puzzle, where each person with their own imagination discovers everything they wish to find, thus inviting us to break paradigms and programming, without losing the essence of what we really are. These are acrylic works, loaded with textures and poetry, with an explicit feeling that speaks, in silence, with their forms and colors.'
